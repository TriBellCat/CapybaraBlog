      Capybaras are distinguished by their heavy, barrel-shaped bodies and short
      heads. Their fur is reddish-brown on the upper parts, transitioning to
      yellowish-brown beneath. These large rodents have blunt snouts, short
      legs, small ears, and almost no tail. Despite their size, capybaras have a
      rather endearing appearance, with a calm and friendly expression that
      reflects their gentle disposition.

      Capybaras are part of a family of rodents known as Caviidae, which
      includes several other species. Their closest living relatives are the
      lesser capybara, guinea pigs, and the rock cavies. They are also related
      to guinea pigs and more distantly to the agouti, chinchilla, and nutria.
      These relatives share a common South American heritage, with adaptations
      that allow them to thrive in varied environments, from dense forests to
      open savannas. The capybara’s lineage is an intriguing tale of evolution
      and adaptation, reflecting the diverse and dynamic ecosystems of their
      native continent.
